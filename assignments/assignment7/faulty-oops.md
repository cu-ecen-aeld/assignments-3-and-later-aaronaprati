# Kernel Oops Analysis

```
echo “hello_world” > /dev/faulty
```
**This is the primary error message. It indicates that the kernel tried to access (dereference) a NULL pointer (address 0x00000000). Accessing a NULL pointer in kernel space it usually results in a crash.**
```
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
```
**This section provides details about the memory abort, which is a type of exception that occurs when the CPU detects an error related to memory access.**
```
Mem abort info:
  ESR = 0x96000045 **"Exception Syndrome Register". It provides information about the most recent exception taken by the processor.**
  EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits 
```
 **EC stands for "Exception Class". It indicates the class or type of exception that occurred. DABT stands for "Data Abort". It's an exception that occurs when there's an issue accessing data memory, such as reading from or writing to an invalid address. "current EL" indicates that the exception occurred at the current Exception Level of the processor. IL stands for "Instruction Length". It indicates the length of the instruction that caused the exception.**
```
  SET = 0, FnV = 0
  EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 ****
  FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault 
```
**EA stands for "External Abort". A value of 0 indicates that the abort was not externally generated.EA stands for "External Abort". A value of 0 indicates that the abort was not externally generated.**
**This section provides more specific details about the data abort, such as whether it was a read or write operation (WnR = 1 indicates a write operation).**
```
Data abort info:
  ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000045
```
 **ISV stands for "Instruction Specific Valid". A value of 0 means that the ISS (Instruction Specific Syndrome) field does not contain valid information about the instruction that caused the abort. If ISV were 1, the ISS would provide more detailed information about the specific instruction. CM stands for "Cache Maintenance". WnR stands for "Write not Read".**
```
  CM = 0, WnR = 1

**This is the kernel oops identifier. "SMP" indicates that the kernel is running in Symmetric Multi-Processing mode, which means it supports multiple CPUs.**
```
Internal error: Oops: 96000045 [#1] SMP
```
**Lists the kernel modules that were loaded at the time of the error. Notably, there's a module named "faulty" which might be related to the error, given its name.**
```
Modules linked in: hello(O) faulty(O) scull(O)

```
**Indicates the hardware platform or configuration on which the kernel is running.**
```
Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)
```
**This is the program counter, which points to the location in the code where the error occurred. The error happened in the faulty_write function of the "faulty" module.**

**This is a stack trace that shows the sequence of function calls leading up to the error. It can help developers understand the sequence of events that led to the crash. In many architectures and operating systems, the memory address 0x00000000 (associated with NULL) is not mapped in kernel space, just as in user space. This means that if the kernel tries to dereference a NULL pointer, it will trigger a fault because it's attempting to access an unmapped address. A kernel panic is a safety mechanism. By halting operations when a critical error is detected, the kernel prevents potential data corruption or further system instability. It's a way for the kernel to say, "Something went seriously wrong, and I don't know how to recover from it."**

**In summary, the kernel encountered an error when trying to dereference a NULL pointer. The error originated from the "faulty" module, specifically within the faulty_write function**
